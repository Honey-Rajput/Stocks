## Key Metrics Explained

### Confidence Score Calculation
```
Base: 65
+ (RSI - 40) × 1.5        Example: (72 - 40) × 1.5 = +48
+ (Vol_Ratio - 1) × 20    Example: (1.73 - 1) × 20 = +14.6
+ Breakout_Strength × 2   Example: 2.68 × 2 = +5.36
─────────────────────────
= 65 + 48 + 14.6 + 5.36 = 132.96 → Capped at 99 ✓
```

**Confidence Zones:**
- 90-99%: Premium setup (institutional quality)
- 80-89%: Strong setup (good entry)
- 70-79%: Decent setup (tradeable)
- 60-69%: Weak setup (skip unless desperate)

---

### Risk/Reward Ratio
```
Risk = (Entry - Stop Loss) = ₹633.4 - ₹601.16 = ₹32.24
Reward = (Target - Entry) = ₹761.52 - ₹633.4 = ₹128.12

Ratio = Reward / Risk = 128.12 / 32.24 = 3.97 : 1
```

**Professional Standards:**
- 1:1 = Acceptable (break-even on failures)
- 1:2 = Good (2 wins pays for 1 loss)
- 1:3+ = Excellent (rare, take it!)

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is confidence 92% but I should still use stop loss?
**A:** Confidence score is "probability price reaches target in 15-20 days", not guaranteed. Market conditions can change. Professional stops protect capital.

### Q: Should I buy all 5 opportunities?
**A:** No. Risk only 1% per trade on stop loss. If account is ₹1L:
- Risk = ₹1000 per trade
- Can do 3-5 trades simultaneously
- Never exceed 5% portfolio risk

### Q: What if price hits stop loss immediately?
**A:** It happens 20-30% of the time. That's why we use 1:3 risk/reward ratios. 3 winners pay for 1 loser + profit.

### Q: Best time to enter?
**A:** First 1-2 hours of trading (9:15-10:45 IST). Volatility and volume are highest. Avoid 10 mins before close (illiquidity).

### Q: Can I hold beyond 20 days?
**A:** Yes, but it becomes position trading, not swing trading. Swing trading edge (20% returns) typically lasts 15-20 days.
